**Abstract**: As frequent travelers, our group members often experience flight delays. However, there is no good way for us to know whether a flight will be delayed in advance. In this project, we aim to address this problem by predicting potential flight delays through analyzing past flight delay records. We first perform exploratory data analysis on various factors that may cause flight delays. We lead the user through our analysis with a narrative and several interactive visualizations. Based on our analysis, we recommend travelers to pick airlines companies with better track records such as Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Delta Airlines, to be prepared to be delayed when traveling in seasonal peaks such as during the summer or in December, and to transfer through bigger hubs as much as possible, especially more advanced hubs in the West Coast such as Seattle, San Fransico, and Los Angeles. Finally, we offer the user a prediction model that, given flight details, predicts how long a flight may be delayed for and its possible causes.

## Introduction

As frequent travelers, our group members often experience flight delays. Flight delays can be heavily disrupted to travel schedules, such as missing important events or having to book extra nights for accommodation. However, this is no good way for us to know whether a flight will be delayed, until the final moment. In this project, we aim to address this problem by predicting potential flight delays through analyzing past flight delay records. Specifically, we ask the following two questions to guide our exploration:

1. What are the main factors that serve as the causes of flight delays? To answer this question, we perform exploratory data analysis and describe our results through several interactive data visualizations.
2. Given a set of factors, can we predict whether a flight is likely to be delayed? To answer this question, we implement a machine learning model to predict flight delays and possible reasons, given a selection of flight details.

In this report, we give an overview of our dataset, outline how we built our interface, visualizations, and machine learning model, and discuss key findings from our data exploration.

## Related Work

Our project is situated among previous works in visualizing flight data and data analysis on flight delays.

### Visualizing Flight Data
Several works have visualized flight data, often using a geographic map. [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/2015/11/25/thanksgiving-flight-patterns/) visualizes US flight patterns during Thanksgivings. [Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2015/08/05/flight-patterns/) showcases a 56-second animation by designer Aaron Koblin of flight paths across the US. [Utrecht University](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~telea001/InfoVis/FlightVis) visualizes US flight patterns with bundling and density detection techniques. [Hui Zhao](https://www.huizhaodesign.com/data-visualization) visualizes global flight paths. [FlightMapper.io](https://flightmapper.io/) provides a tool for creating 3D flight path visualizations. In this project, we also visualize flight patterns with a geographic map. However, we additionally encode flight delay time information within the interactive visualization. Furthermore, we dive deep into the various factors that may have caused flight delays through a narrative with additional interactive visualizations.

### Flight Delays Data Analysis
Various data science projects have attempted to analyze flight delay data. Several notable examples on Kaggle include projects by [Fabien Daniel](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/predicting-flight-delays-tutorial), [Hakki Kaan Simsek](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hakkisimsek/plotly-tutorial-2), [Miquar](https://www.kaggle.com/code/miquar/explore-flights-csv-airports-csv-airlines-csv), [Manasi Chhibber](https://www.kaggle.com/code/manasichhibber/flight-delay-predictions), and [DSEverything](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dongxu027/airline-delays-eda-deep-dive-lessons-learned). Nonetheless, the visualizations in the projects are mostly simplistic, such as bar charts, with little interaction. In this project, we explore more advanced visualizations and support greater interactivity and user control over the data.

## Methods

### Data Processing

#### Data Cleaning and Augmentation

We use a dataset containing flight delay records from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics - On-Time : Marketing Carrier On-Time Performance](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGK&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr). The full dataset is very large (many millions of data points) - spanning from January 2018 to August 2022 with over 100 fields. For the purpose of this project, we select a subset of the data from January 2021 to December 2021 and include only 23 fields. The 23 fields are:
* Time information (YEAR, QUARTER, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK) - We include this to uncover correlations between time and flight delays. We also hypothesize that day of the week (e.g. Monday) will influence flight delays.
* Flight carrier (OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER, OP_CARRIER_FL_NUM) - We include this to uncover correlations between flight carriers (e.g. United Airlines) and flight delays.
* Location information (ORIGIN, DEST, DISTANCE) - We include this to uncover correlations between location/distance and flight delays.
* Flight times, delays, and reasons (CRS_DEP_TIME, DEP_TIME, DEP_DELAY, CRS_ARR_TIME, ARR_TIME, ARR_DELAY, CARRIER_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY, NAS_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY) - We include this to measure whether a flight is delayed and the degree that it was delayed for. We also include the reasons behind the delays (e.g. weather) to see if they have correlations with other fields (e.g. location).
* Cancellations and reasons (CANCELLED, CANCELLATION_CODE) - Like delays and reasons, we include similar attributes for cancellations.

Our uncleaned dataset contains 6,311,871 data points.

<img src="image/img_1.png" alt="uncleaned dataset" width="500"/>

For data cleaning, we first drop duplicates and remove data points that contain empty fields. Then, we separate flights that are delayed and cancelled. For delayed flights, we data points that do not have a delay reason (e.g. one of CARRIER_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY, NAS_DELAY, SECURITY_DELAY, LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY). For canceled flights, we similarly remove data points that do not have a cancellation reason (CANCELLATION_CODE).

We also augment our dataset with more fine-grained geographic information as we would like to create a geographic map to visualize the flight delays. Therefore, we map airport location (ORIGIN, DEST) to US state names and coordinates (latitude and longitude) from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=airports.csv). This adds 6 more fields to our dataset (ORIGIN_STATE, ORIGIN_LAT, ORIGIN_LONG, DEST_STATE, DEST_LAT, DEST_LONG). We remove data points that include airports with unknown geographical locations.

Our final dataset contains 1,141,693 data points with 29 fields.

#### Data Exploration

<img src="image/img_3.png" alt="basic data exploration" width="400"/>

We explored the relationship between DEP_DELAY and factors including MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK, OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER, ORIGIN, DEST, DEP_TIME, and DISTANCE.
These explorations provide us with the following inspirations:

* Divide the DEP_DELAY(delay time) into different intervals as there are too many data points, which is hard for us to tell the correlations. 

* Instead of using scatter plots, we probably need to use binned scatter points to better display the distribution of the dataset.

* When exploring relationships between ORIGIN (departure location) and DEP_DELAY, it makes more sense to use a map.

* Meanwhile, we find that aside from the number of flights, the percentage of flights(delayed flights/all flights) is also important, as some big hubs might have more flights and therefore have more delays, but that doesnâ€™t mean you have a higher chance of delay when you depart from this city.

### Interface

We use Streamlit for our interface implementation. Our app is a multipage app containing the Home page, the Prediction page, and the Visualization page. We use [Streamlit Extras](https://github.com/arnaudmiribel/streamlit-extras) to support page switching buttons. We use caching (`@st.cache()`) for intensive operations such as downloading the data file hosted on Google Drive.

#### Home Page

The Home page gives a quick introduction of the project and an overview of the dataset the project is built on. The user may view the full dataset from an expander. In addition, two buttons lead to the other two pages.

<img src="image/home_interface.png" alt="home interface" width="400"/>

#### Prediction Page

The Prediction page allows users to fill in their flight information in a form. The form has various input fields such as an airline selection box, date picker, and text input fields. We have some basic data validation such as checking if the flight number is numeric and whether the arrival and departure airports are different. Based on user-provided details, we predict probabilities that the flight will be delayed or cancelled (see Machine Learning Model section).

<img src="image/prediction_interface.png" alt="prediction interface" width="400"/>

#### Visualization Page

The Visualization page presents our data explorations with several interactive data visualizations (see Visualization section and Results section). The user may play around with various input parameters based on their data exploration interests.

<img src="image/visualization.png" alt="visualization interface" width="400"/>

### Visualization

We use Altair and Matplotlib for our visualizations implementation. The main challenge we faced when doing visualization was choosing the best charts for our data.

#### Box Plot

We used box plots to show distributions of flight delay values based on airline companies and flight departure time. They can display the five-number summary of a group of data. The five-number summary includes the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

#### Binned Scatter Plot

We used binned scatter plots to investigate the relationship between flight delay time and flight distance. The data points in a binned scatter plot are grouped into bins, and an aggregate statistic is used to summarize each bin. For example, we can use a circular area to represent the count and show the density of data points.

#### Map

We used Maps to explore the relationship between flight delay time and geographical features like states or cities. With the map, we can show the delay amount/average time at a give place along with their geographic distribution. 

#### Interactive Chart with Cross-Highlight

The reason we want to show a cross-highlight chart is to tell apart the amount of delay flights and the percentage of delay flights. With higher overall flight amount, there will be more delay flights, but that doesn't mean there is higher chance of delay. So we used the cross-highlight chart to put delay amount & percentage side by side. And we added an interactive bar chart as brush to provide more detailed insight about specfic Airlines.

#### Interactive Chart with Maps & Connections

To provide more detailed insights about the geographical distribution, we used maps with interactive dots to show the connections between places. In this way we can see the delay amount/average time between the origin and destination cities along with their geographic distribution. 


### Machine Learning Model
Linear and logistic regression models are trained to predict the delay time for each reason and the probability of flight cancellation. 

#### Data Preprocessing for ML Models
When training the models, we only kept the flight information accessible to the travelers as the input. Therefore, the inputs include the date, day of the week, scheduled departure time, scheduled arrival time, origin, destination, carrier, and flight number. We performed one-hot encoding on the categorical features such as carrier, origin, and destination. We also standardized the numerical features to allow a better performance for the scikit-learn package.

#### Delay Time Prediction
Five linear regression models were trained to predict the delay time for each of the delay reasons (career, weather, National Airspace System, security, late aircraft). The total delay time is calculated by adding the five predicted delay times together. Mean absolute errors were calculated to evaluate the performance on the validation set. We also explored some shallow neural networks but did not see much performance difference. 

#### Cancellation Probability Prediction
A logistic regression model was trained to predict the possibility of cancellation. The accuracy on the validation set is 91%. The probability is predicted with the predict_proba(X) function in the scikit-learn logistic regression model, which estimate the probability of each label class.



## Results

We studied the relationship between flight delay time and some factors including airline companies, flight departure time, flight distance and flight destination.

### Airline Companies

We firstly compared the delay time based on airline companies in a box plot. The median and the interquartile range in each box well demonstrate the performance of each airline in flight delay. Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines are the best 3 performers. Some airlines like Skywest Airlines and JetBlue Airlines do need to pay more attention to their flight delay issues.

Based on the box plot, we identified that the delay time could be categorized into <20 minutes, 20-60 minutes, and >60 minutes. If it is smaller than 20, it is approximately on time. If it is between 20 and 60, it is a small delay that most people can tolerate. If it is larger than 60, the flight encounters a serious delay.

With the new categories of delay, it is easy to observe that the proportion of delays varies from airline to airline. Some airlines like JetBlue Airlines behave badly. They have a relatively low on-time rate and a relatively high large delay rate. Although SouthWest Airlines has the largest number of flight delays, these delays are mainly small delays and the company maintains a pretty good on-time rate.

<div align=center><img width="1000" height="400" src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/report1.png"/></div>

To sum up, airline companies behave very much differently in dealing with flight delay problems. It is safe to deduce that choosing an airline company would influence flight delay.

### Flight Departure Time

We then sketched another box plot to study the distributions of flight delay time values based on flight departure time (Quarter / Month / Day of Week). It can be observed that: (1) a long flight delay is more likely to happen in Quarter 2 & 3 than in Quarter 1 & 4; (2) it is more likely to encounter a flight delay on Monday.

<div align=center><img width="900" height="350" src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/report2.png"/></div>

To sum up, flight time is also an important factor leading to flight delay. Long flight delays are more likely to happen during the summer or on Monday.

### Flight Distance

We then drew a binned scattered plot to identify the relationship between delay time and flight distance. The data points in the plot are grouped into bins with a circle in each bin to represent the amount of flights in that bin and its percentage to the total number of flights.

<div align=center><img width="600" height="300" src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/report3.png"/></div>

It can be seen in the plot that flight distance seems not to be a key factor to delay time.

### Flight Destination

We are also interested the relationship between the delay time and destination. We want to see whether there are some destinations that are likely to delay longer time than other places. The data points in the plot are grouped into states. We caluculated the average delay time for the flights that arrives at each state.to avoid the impact of extreme data points, we only take delay times that are under 400 mins.

<div align=center><img width="600"  src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/flight_destination.png"/></div>

We can see if you are planning to go to the north eastern part of the country, the flights might delay longer.

### Flight Origin

Same as the previous one, we also want to see relationship between the delay time and origins.

<div align=center><img width="600"  src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/flight_origin.png"/></div>

We can see from the map that if you departure from several states in the middle US (like North Dakota, Wyoming or Mississipi)you might delay for longer time.

### Flight Distribution Over Time

To further discuss the relationship between delay time and different timestamp, we take a look at the delay time. The color indicates the number of flights with the delay time (y-axis) on the given time categoary (x-axis) for a selected time scale. The size of circle indicates the percentage (likelihood) of a delay time occured on each time categoary. Randomly sample 5000 from the data for efficient computation purpose.

<div align=center><img width="600"  src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/quarter_delay_distribution.png"/></div>

If we choose quarter at the above chart, we can see that quarter 3 has the most number of flights thats delay under 40 mins, it seems that quarter 3 might be a good choice to fly. But if we take a look at the percentage(likelyhood) of a delay time happend in each quarter, we can see that quarter 1 actually has the highest percentage of flights that delay under 40 mins, which means, if you travel in quarter 1, you'll have higher chance to delay for a little while. Likewise, we can also see March and Wednesday has the lowest chances of delay higher than 40. These time might be the better choice for flying.

<div align=center><img width="600"  src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/AA_week_delay.png"/></div>

We could also spect the distribution for specfic airlines. Take American Airline (AA) as an example, we can see Wednesday has most flights and lowest delay rate, which makes Wednesday a best choice for AA. Similar ideas can be applied to quarters and months.


### Flight Delay Distribution over Origin and Destination
Finally, we want to see whether there are some specific routes between cities are especially likely to delay. The circle indicate the number of flights departed from this airport. We can see there are some larger airport hub where the circles are larger. If we hover on one airport, we can see all the routes that departs from this airport. The width of the connection indicates the number of flights between the two airports and the color of the edge indicates the average delay time between the two airports.

<div align=center><img width="600"  src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/orgin_dest_distribution.png"/></div>

Let's take Chicago ORD airport as an example. We can see it has most frequent flights to Los Angles, and the delay time is relatively low. However if you go to Rhode Island from Chicago, there will be less flights options and there are higher chances for delay.

<div align=center><img width="600"  src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/Chicago.png"/></div>

P.S. We randomly sampled 5000 from the dataset for efficient computation purpose.
## Discussion
With our app, we provide the audience with sufficient information to make a wise choice for their flights to mitigate the chance of delayed flights. From the analysis of different factors, we managed to draw insights and analyze the reasons behind the flight delays.

### 1. Airline company matters to flight delay
Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Delta Airlines are the best 3 performers. Some airlines like Skywest Airlines and JetBlue Airlines do need to pay more attention to their flight delay issues. Choosing a flight carrier wisely allows potential travelers to save time from potential flight delays.

### 2. Prepared to be delayed when flying in summer and December
The flight delay is highly related to the time when people travel. Generally, a long flight delay is more likely to happen in Quarter 2 & 3 than in Quarter 1 & 4. However, there is also a relatively long flight delay in December, which might be caused by the holiday season. In addition, people are more likely to experience a long flight delay on Sundays possibly due to a high volume of people needing to go back to work.


### 3. Likely to be 30-min delay regardless of the distance
It is interesting to observe that the traveling distance is not a significant factor that impacts the flight delay. Flights usually delay around 30 minutes regardless of the travel distance. Surprisingly, long flight distance usually does not have a longer delay time. A plausible explanation behind this observation could be that the flights can fly faster to make up for the lost time and mitigate the arrival delay.

### 4. Peace in mind when flying â€˜In-N-Outâ€™ on the West Coast
The departure and arrival locations usually have a strong impact on flight delays. Departure and arrival flights in North Dakota are very likely to be delayed for a longer period of time based on historical data. On the other hand, flights arriving and departing on the West Coast are more likely to be on time. The airport facilities on the West Coast, such as in Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles are more advanced and can handle the traffic better than a state like North Dakota.


### 5. Watch out for your timing and your carrier
When combining the flight time and carrier, a more clear picture is drawn for the audience. Comparing United Airlines with Delta Airlines (with a similar number of flights), we can see United Airlines is more likely to have longer delays than Delta. Longer delays (350-400min) happen more frequently in December compared to the other months, which might be caused by the holiday season. The shorter and medium delays (50-300min) happen more frequently in June-August, which might indicate that people travel more often in the summertime. There are fewer flights from January-April, which might indicate that fewer people choose to travel during this time.


### 6. Worry less when traveling between big hubs
When looking at the number of fights and average delay time among different airports on the map, we found that the average delay time of flights between two big hubs is shorter than that of flights from a big hub to a smaller airport. A rational hypothesis is that the airports prefer prioritizing flights between two big hubs. In addition, smaller airports usually only connect to a few big hubs and are likely to have longer average delay times. Therefore, travelers should choose flights between big hubs whenever possible to avoid potential flight delays.


## Future Work

We utilize a linear regression model to predict the delay time based on the selected features. To refine the app prediction accuracy, we could explore different machine learning models, such as decision trees and neural networks. Also, the current model is trained with the whole dataset. Since cases may vary between airlines, the prediction might be more accurate if we could develop models for each airline separately. To extend the accessibility of the app, we could consider embedding this app into some existing platforms, such as google flights. Moreover, we could consider developing a mobile version to ensure users can easily access it during traveling.
