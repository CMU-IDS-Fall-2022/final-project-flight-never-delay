### Data Processing and Interface



### Visualization

The main challenge we faced when doing visualization was choosing the best charts for our data.

+ Box Plot

We used box plots to show distributions of flight delay values based on airline companies and flight departure time. They can display the five-number summary of a group of data. The five-number summary includes the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

+ Binned Scatter Plot

We used binned scatter plots to investigate the relationship between flight delay time and flight distance. The data points in a binned scatter plot are grouped into bins, and an aggregate statistic is used to summarize each bin. For example, we can use a circular area to represent the count and show the density of data points.

## Results

We studied the relationship between flight delay time and some factors including airline companies, flight departure time, flight distance and flight destination.

+ Airline Companies

We firstly compared the delay time based on airline companies in a box plot. The median and the interquartile range in each box well demonstrate the performance of each airline in flight delay. Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines are the best 3 performers. Some airlines like Skywest Airlines and JetBlue Airlines do need to pay more attention to their flight delay issues.

Based on the box plot, we identified that the delay time could be categorized into <20 minutes, 20-60 minutes, and >60 minutes. If it is smaller than 20, it is approximately on time. If it is between 20 and 60, it is a small delay that most people can tolerate. If it is larger than 60, the flight encounters a serious delay.

With the new categories of delay, it is easy to observe that the proportion of delays varies from airline to airline. Some airlines like JetBlue Airlines behave badly. They have a relatively low on-time rate and a relatively high large delay rate. Although SouthWest Airlines has the largest number of flight delays, these delays are mainly small delays and the company maintains a pretty good on-time rate.

To sum up, airline companies behave very much differently in dealing with flight delay problems. It is safe to deduce that choosing an airline company would influence flight delay.

+ Flight Departure Time

We then sketched another box plot to study the distributions of flight delay time values based on flight departure time (Quarter / Month / Day of Week). It can be observed that: (1) a long flight delay is more likely to happen in Quarter 2 & 3 than in Quarter 1 & 4; (2) it is more likely to encounter a flight delay on Monday.

To sum up, flight time is also an important factor leading to flight delay. Long flight delays are more likely to happen during the summer or on Monday.

+ Flight Distance

We then drew a binned scattered plot to identify the relationship between delay time and flight distance. The data points in the plot are grouped into bins with a circle in each bin to represent the amount of flights in that bin and its percentage to the total number of flights.

<div align=center><img width="700" height="300" src="https://github.com/CMU-IDS-Fall-2022/final-project-flight-never-delay/blob/main/image/report3.png"/></div>

It can be seen in the plot that flight distance seems not to be a key factor to delay time.

+ Flight Destination
