### Data Processing and Interface



### Visualization

The main challenge we faced when doing visualization was choosing the best charts for our data.

+ Box Plot

We used box plots to show distributions of flight delay values based on airline companies and flight departure time. They can display the five-number summary of a group of data. The five-number summary includes the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

+ Binned Scatter Plot

We used binned scatter plots to investigate the relationship between flight delay time and flight distance. The data points in a binned scatter plot are grouped into bins, and an aggregate statistic is used to summarize each bin. For example, we can use a circular area to represent the count and show the density of data points.

+ Map



+ Interactive Chart with Cross-Highlight



### Machine Learning Model



## Results

We studied the relationship between flight delay time and some factors including airline companies, flight departure time, flight distance and flight destination.

+ Airline Companies
